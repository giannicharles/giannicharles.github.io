    <h1>Oral/ Written Communication</h1>

    <p>The artifact I've chosen to represent my proficiency in the Oral/Written Communication competency is a research paper titled "Embracing the Final Journey: Unveiling the Funeral Home Industry's Impacts, Cultural Dynamics, Transformations, and Ethical Considerations." This paper was a product of my engagement in the 'Death and Dying' class.

    To complete this paper, I utilized knowledge gleaned from our class textbook, an interview with a Funeral Home Director, and a virtual cemetery tour. These resources allowed me to address six essential questions posed by my instructor:

    Firstly, I explored the profound impacts of funeral rituals and body disposition methods on local and global communities. Secondly, I delved into the intricate ways cultural beliefs and rituals influence choices regarding body disposition, encompassing various perspectives such as Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Hindu traditions.

    This research paper also opened my eyes to the dynamic nature of the funeral home industry and its connections to my academic field. It prompted me to consider how concepts from my academic pursuits could be related and applied in this context. Moreover, it underlined the importance of ethical considerations for Funeral Home Directors, emphasizing the need to prioritize empathy and respect for grieving families.

    Lastly, I investigated the role of government in regulating the funeral home industry and controlling the costs of funerals, providing insights into the broader implications of governmental involvement in such matters.

    I take pride in this work because it reflects my diligent efforts and the skills I've honed in the course. It is a testament to my ability to communicate effectively, synthesize complex information, and organize ideas coherently.

    As a valuable sample for future employers, this artifact showcases my proficiency in Oral/Written Communication. It highlights my competence in research and my capacity to present complex information efficiently. Beyond its immediate subject matter, the paper also touches on themes of cultural diversity, ethics, government regulation, and community impact, making it relevant to a wider audience interested in understanding the intersections of these diverse fields.

    In conclusion, this artifact is not only a representation of my proficiency but also a reflection of my adaptability, interdisciplinary approach, and the ability to connect knowledge across various academic domains. It embodies the skills and experiences I aim to bring to my future endeavors, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.</p>
