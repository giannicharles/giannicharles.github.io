    <h1>Teamwork</h1>

    <p>The artifact I've chosen for reflection is a report titled 'The Computable Navigate-A-Bull and What That Says About Project-Based Learning.' This report was the result of a group assignment in my Foundations of Engineering Lab. To complete it, we were tasked with developing a phone app that could teach students about app development while also helping fellow students with disabilities navigate campus. The app had to be user-programmable within a few minutes and include valuable content for individuals with disabilities.

    I selected this artifact to represent my teamwork competency because it truly epitomizes the essence of collaboration. Throughout this project, I served as the team leader, responsible for organizing meetings, resolving conflicts, and keeping the team motivated. It was a challenging role that demanded not only technical knowledge but also interpersonal skills.

    What I gained from this experience was invaluable. I learned to navigate the intricacies of team dynamics, ensuring that everyone's strengths were utilized effectively. I maintained the team's morale and ensured that we stayed on track. The end result was exceptional, and our team received high praise, a testament to our collective effort.

    I take pride in this work because it showcases my ability to lead and collaborate effectively. Our project's success was reflected in the high score we achieved, making our team one of the top performers in the class. It's gratifying to see the tangible outcomes of hard work and dedication.

    This artifact is a valuable addition to my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my teamwork, critical thinking, professional, and leadership competencies. Future employers would find it insightful as it highlights not only my technical skills but also my ability to work in diverse teams, an essential quality in the professional world.

    Moreover, it fits into the narrative I'm constructing in my ePortfolio, illustrating a significant personal growth journey. It showcases how I absorbed theoretical knowledge and translated it into a practical solution, reinforcing the idea that I am a well-rounded and adaptable individual ready to excel in various professional roles.

    In conclusion, the 'Computable Navigate-A-Bull' project report is a prime example of my teamwork competency, reflecting my growth as a person and my ability to lead and collaborate effectively. It adds depth to my ePortfolio, offering evidence of my skills and experiences to future employers who value individuals capable of making a meaningful impact through teamwork and innovation.</p>
