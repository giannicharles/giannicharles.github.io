    <h1>Leadership</h1>

    <p>In my Composition 2 course, we tackled the challenging question of whether USF's government funding should be increased. This group presentation, which included five members, each responsible for their research and presentation content, was an excellent opportunity to showcase my leadership competency. As the group leader and presenter, my role was pivotal, and it demonstrated several key aspects of leadership. I coordinated the team by assigning roles, setting expectations, and ensuring everyone's strengths were effectively utilized. The planning process involved creating a structured presentation outline and setting deadlines, allowing us to stay on track and meet our objectives. Effective communication within the team was essential, and I facilitated regular meetings, addressed conflicts, and ensured that everyone had a voice. During the presentation, my role as the primary presenter showcased my strong voice control and ability to capture the audience's attention.

      This experience also highlighted the importance of adaptability as our feedback suggested revisiting ideas in the closing for a more impactful ending. This valuable feedback emphasized the need for continuous self-improvement, a trait highly valued in any leadership role. The presentation received a good grade, and our teacher praised my leadership and presentation skills. Future employers would find this artifact valuable as it showcases my leadership, teamwork, and communication skills, essential qualities in professional settings. It also demonstrates my ability to adapt to feedback for ongoing growth. The Composition 2 group presentation aligns with the narrative of my ePortfolio, providing substantial evidence of my leadership and communication skills in a real-world context. In conclusion, this artifact enhances my representation of the leadership competency and strengthens my ePortfolio's narrative, offering tangible proof of my leadership abilities to future employers and academic institutions.</p>
